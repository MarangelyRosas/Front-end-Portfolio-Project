            <h1>Sudoku Unravel Instructions:</h1>
            <p>The point of my Sudoku Unravel is for anyone who is struggling trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle to get the answer to their puzzle. It's basically like a puzzle answer revealer or better yet said, a puzzle solver. You can use my Sudoku Unravel in two different ways.               
            </p>
            <p>1. If you are trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle at home, for instance in a Sudoku puzzle book that you may have, you just would have to input the numbers given to you in the book into the correct square on my Sudoku Unravel Puzzle Board, then click solve, and it will unravel the remaining numbers revealing the answer to the puzzle along with a message saying "This is the answer to your puzzle!"                   
            </p>
            <p>2. You can also use my Sudoku Unravel to challenge yourself by making up your 'own' Sudoku Puzzle. If you do create your own puzzle, input numbers into each square until you get stuck. Then click the solve button, and it will either unravel the remaining numbers in the puzzle, revealing the answer/solution if the puzzle is solvable. It will also display a message that reads "This is the answer to your puzzle!".
                              OR
                If the puzzle you created is not solvable/ doesn't have a solution, upon clicking the solve button, no additional numbers will be unraveled and a message that reads "This puzzle is not solvable!" will display on the page.

        <h2>Below Are The Actual Rules Of The Sudoku Game For Anyone Who Wants To Learn How To Play.</h2>      
        
        <h3>Sudoku Game Rules:</h3>
        <p><strong>Rule № 1:</strong> You Can Only Use Numbers 1-9</p>
            Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rule № 2:</strong> Don’t Repeat Any Numbers</p>
        <p>By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rule № 3:</strong> Don’t Guess</p>
        <p>Sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule № 4:</strong> Use Process of Elimination</p>
        <p>One way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking to see which other numbers are already included within each square – since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).</p>
        <p>This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku – you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing – and then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.</p>
        <p>Sudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated – but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it’s all based on the simple principles of using numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each square, row or column.
        </p>
        <p><strong>TIPS/SUGGESTIONS:</strong></p>
        <p> There are more than a few techniques to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but the easiest way to a Sudoku solution is to “Scan rows and columns within each triple-box area, eliminating numbers or squares, and finding situations where only a single number can fit into a single square.”

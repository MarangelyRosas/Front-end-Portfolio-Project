        <p> There are more than a few techniques to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but the easiest way to a Sudoku solution is to “Scan rows and columns within each triple-box area, eliminating numbers or squares, and finding situations where only a single number can fit into a single square.”
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>Rules of the Game:</p>
        <p>Sudoku Rule № 1: You Can Only Use Numbers 1-9</p>
            Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.
        </p>
        <p>Sudoku Rule № 2: Don’t Repeat Any Numbers</p>
        <p>By seeing which numbers are missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.
        </p>
        <p>Sudoku Rule № 3: Don’t Guess</p>
        <p>Sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to place a number. But don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.</p>
        <p>Sudoku Rule № 4: Use Process of Elimination</p>
        <p>One way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking to see which other numbers are already included within each square – since there can be no duplication of numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).</p>
        <p>This is how the process of elimination works in Sudoku – you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing – and then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each space.</p>
        <p>Sudoku rules are relatively uncomplicated – but the game is infinitely varied, with millions of possible number combinations and a wide range of levels of difficulty. But it’s all based on the simple principles of using numbers 1-9, filling in the blank spaces based on deductive reasoning, and never repeating any numbers within each square, row or column.

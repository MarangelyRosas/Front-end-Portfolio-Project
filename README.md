## Sudoku Unravel Instructions:
The point of my Sudoku Unravel is for anyone who is struggling trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle to get the answer to their puzzle. It's basically like a puzzle answer revealer or better yet said, a puzzle solver. You can use my Sudoku Unravel in two different ways.

1. If you are trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle at home, for instance in a Sudoku puzzle book that you may have, you just would have to input the numbers given to you in the book into the correct square on my Sudoku Unravel Puzzle Board, then click solve, and it will unravel the remaining numbers revealing the answer to the puzzle along with a message saying "This is the answer to your puzzle!"

2. You can also use my Sudoku Unravel to challenge yourself by making up your 'own' Sudoku Puzzle. If you do create your own puzzle, input numbers into each square until you get stuck, then click the solve button and it will either unravel the remaining numbers in the puzzle revealing the answer if the puzzle is solvable, displaying a message that reads "This is the answer to your puzzle!".
#              OR
If the puzzle you created is not solvable, upon clicking the solve button, no additional numbers will be unraveled and a message that reads "This puzzle is not solvable!" will display on the page.

## IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARPEN YOUR SKILLS, YOU CAN PRACTICE ON MY SUDOKU UNRAVEL PUZZLE BOARD.

## EXTRA INFORMATION/SUGGESTIONS: 
There are more than a few techniques to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but the easiest way to a Sudoku solution is to “Scan rows and columns within each triple-box area, eliminating numbers or squares, and finding situations where only a single number can fit into a single square.” 
Make sure to get numbers from 1-9 across each row, column, as well as in each of the 9 squares.

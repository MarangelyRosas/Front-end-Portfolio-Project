## Sudoku Unravel
The point of my Sudoku Unravel is for anyone who is struggling trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle to get the answer to their puzzle. It's basically like a 'cheat sheet' or better yet said, a 'puzzle answer revealer'. 

## Instructions 

There are more than a few techniques to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but the easiest way to a Sudoku solution is to “Scan rows and columns within each triple-box area, eliminating numbers or squares, and finding situations where only a single number can fit into a single square.” 
Make sure to get numbers from 1-9 across each row, column, as well as in each of the 9 squares.
 
## Rules of the Game:
1. Sudoku grid consists of 9x9 spaces.
2. You can use only numbers from 1 to 9.
3. Each 3×3 block can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
4. Each vertical column can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
5. Each horizontal row can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
6. Each number in the 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row can be used only once.
7. The game is over when the whole Sudoku grid is correctly filled with numbers.
